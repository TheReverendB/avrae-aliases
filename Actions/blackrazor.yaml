      While you hold the weapon, you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger
      creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also
      can't be charmed or frightened.


      Blackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to.

          Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays
          the creature and devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an
          undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be
          restored to life only by a wish spell.


          When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain  creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.
